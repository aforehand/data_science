next steps for ensemble stacking
######################################################################
review pandas join and groupby
place continuous features into buckets with pd.qcut
kmeans can be used to find good buckets
or quantiles, or find the intervals which maximize the information gain of
discretizing the feature with respect to the target variable.
reduce the number of name categories, combine all rare titles
drop useless features
has cabin feature? name length feature?
make a seaborn heatmap to see feature correlations
make pairplots to see the distribution of data from one feature to another
make a DataFrame of the feature importances for each base algorithm
add column for mean
make a DataFrame of the predictions for each base algorithm
concatenate train/test from each algorithm as input to next level algorithm
train an XGBClassifier on the first level data
(XGB can fill in nans on its own!)
