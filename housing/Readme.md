Ran a two-tailed independent t-test ('housing_prices_ttest.py') to compare the percentage
change in housing prices in college towns vs. other locations between the start and bottom
of the 2008-2009 recession.

Housing prices in college towns were significantly less affected by recession (p < 0.05) 
than elsewhere.
