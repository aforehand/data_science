This project is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team.
The challenge concerns the problem of blight, where properties (particularly
in Detroit) remain in a deteriorated condition. The city issues fines to
combat blight, but a large majority of these go unpaid. The central question is:
how can blight ticket compliance be increased?

I tested several models to predict fine payment, which I evaluated based on
their ROC AUC score. I chose AUC for two reasons: 1) The classes are highly
imbalanced, so any model will have high accuracy; and 2) in the context of this
problem it is more important to minimize false positives than false negatives.
Polynomial and ridge regression produced the highest ROC AUC score of 0.8, as
shown in blight.py. The next highest-performing model was random forest, which
only achieved an AUC of 0.66.

 After settling on a model, I looked its coefficients for insight into what
 might be done to increase the rate of fine payment. The coefficients generated
 by this model suggest that blight fine payment is influenced most strongly by
 the features 'discount amount', 'disposition', 'fine amount', 'late fee', and
 'judgement amount' in various combinations. Below are the results of some
 analyses of these features by class.

Based on these analyses, I suggest the following measures to increase blight
ticket compliance:
1. Offer a discount off the fine. This is by far the largest predictor of fine
payment.
2. Incentivize attending the hearing. Those who did not receive default
determinations were much more likely to pay than those who did.
3. Lower the fine amounts.

I used the following DataFrames to analyze features by class:
paid_df = train_df[train_df.compliance==1.0]
not_paid_df = train_df[train_df.compliance==0.0]

All p-values given are for the Mann-Whitney u-test.

DISPOSITION

paid:
Responsible by Determination: 0.203
Responsible by Admission: 0.325
Responsible by Default: 0.456
Responsible (Fine Waived) by Deter: 0.017

unpaid:
Responsible by Default: 0.897
Responsible by Admission: 0.067
Responsible by Determination: 0.036

These data show that a large percentage of those who do not pay their fines
are found responsible by default, while those who do pay their fines show a
wider spread of judgements. Of those who were found responsible by default, only
3% paid their fine, compared with 29% of those with other determinations. I
interpret this as suggesting that someone simply showing up to their hearing
increases the likelihood that they will pay their fine.

DISCOUNT AMOUNT

95% of those who received a discount on their fine paid it, compared to 7% of
those who received no discount. For those who  received a discount, the mean
amount was somewhat different between those who paid and those who did not ($27
vs. $22, p=0.012). The discount was about 10% of the fine in each case. Among
those who paid their fine, the mean fine amount for those given a discount was
significantly higher than those that were not discounted ($267 vs. $235, p
<<0.01); the reverse was true for those who did not pay ($226 vs. $366, p<<0.01).
Interestingly, those who paid a discounted fine paid significantly *more* in
total than those who paid a fine with no discount ($240 vs. $235, p<<0.01).

FINE AMOUNT

While the median fine value for both groups is $250, the mean value is
significantly higher for the not paid group ($238 vs. $366, p<<0.01). Also, as
the fine amount increased, there was an overall decrease in the percentage of
people who paid: the maximum was between $50-$80 at 11%, which quickly fell
between $130-$200 at 6%, and steadily decreased from there. Looking at the only
violation code for which those who paid were given the maximum fine ($10,000),
57% of those who paid were fined $200 or less, 90% paid $1000 or less, and 6%
paid $3500 or more. For those who did not pay, 40% were fined $200 or less, 71%
were fined $1000 or less, and 21% were fined $3500 or more. Additionally, those
who did not pay received the maximum fine for five more violation codes. This
suggests that giving a larger fine decreases the likelihood that it will be paid.
#######################################################################
LATE FEE

52% of those who paid received a late fee, compared with 93% of those who
did not pay. This makes sense given that only those who pay could receive no
late fee. The late fee amount is correlated with the fine amount (r^2=1.0).

JUDGMENT AMOUNT

The judgement amount is correlated with the fine amount (r^2=0.9997)
