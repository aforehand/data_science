## Blight Compliance Predictor

This is an analysis of a data set of blight fines issued by the city of Detroit to determine how the city can increase fine compliance. Based on my analysis, I suggest the following measures to increase blight ticket compliance:
1. Offer a discount off the fine. This is by far the largest predictor of fine
payment.
2. Incentivize attending the hearing. Those who did not receive default
determinations were much more likely to pay than those who did.
3. Lower the fine amounts.
